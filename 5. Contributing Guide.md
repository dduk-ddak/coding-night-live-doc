# Contributing Guide

If youâ€™re looking to contribute to **Coding-Night-Live**, then please read on-we encourage contributions both large and small, from both novice and seasoned developers.

## We need your help in the following areas

- Documentation
- Debugging and testing
- Adding more functions
- Refactoring
- Resolving existing issues

## You can contribute too! :+1: 

The first thing you'll need is to fork our project. When you have changes you'd like to have reviewed for integration, submit a pull request.

## Documentation

We have two main sets of documentation: *README* contains a brief overview of the project `Coding-Night-Live`, and *Wiki* serves as the guideline for users.

You can help improve the documentation by making them more coherent, readable, adding missing information, correcting factual errors, fixing typos, or bringing them up-to-date with the latest.

## Bug Report

If you find a bug, please report it to us using the [Issues](https://github.com/dduk-ddak/coding-night-live/issues) page on GitHub and add appropriate Labels(`bug`, ..).

But you should reproduce the reported issue on your own computer. So verifying bug reports is essential.

And we're also using error logging system with [`Sentry`](https://sentry.io/dduk-ddak/). so you don't need a capture page for every error log.

## Issue a Pull Request

Ensure the changes you introduced are included. Fill in some details about your potential patch including a meaningful title. And please add appropriate labels. When finished, send a pull request. We will be notified about your submission.
